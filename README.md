## lose documentation
- Execute program with ./run from root directory
- Configuration files can be found in configs directory 
- Program output can be found in output.txt located in root directory
- Additional dynamical systems can be added by modifying src/data\_generation.py file. Template can be found at top of file.

## NGRC overview
- data generation
- feature vector construction
- perform regression
- calculate training fit NRMSE
- make prediction
- calculate prediction NRMSE

## Regression methods
This program can use Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net regression methods
