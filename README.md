# Masters\_CE
Generalized Next Generation Reservoir Computing (NGRC)

## working documentation
- Execute program with ./scripts/run from root directory
- Configuration files can be found in configs directory 
- Program results can be found in results/output.txt and results/plot.png
- Additional dynamical systems can be added by modifying src/data\_generation.py file. Template can be found at top of file.

## NGRC overview
1. data generation
2. feature vector construction
3. perform regression
4. calculate training fit NRMSE
5. make prediction
6. calculate prediction NRMSE
